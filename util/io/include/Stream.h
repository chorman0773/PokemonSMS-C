*  The number of bytes written is stored in *size_out (but this does not necessarily equal the size of the allocated storage).
* ptr may point to a null pointer (but may not itself be null) If so, the buffer is initially created by a call to malloc with an unspecified size when the first write occurs.
* The buffer at *ptr MUST NOT be freed in the lifetime of a constructed output Stream, but must be freed by a call to free after it is no longer used. The buffer at *ptr may be read or written to, up to size_out, except concurrently to a write operation.

*   For InputStream Constructor: buff shall point to a valid object, and at least size bytes shall be write-reachable through that object. Write-Reachability is described in OutputStream_write(OutputStream* stream,const void* data,size_t sz). For reachability purposes for calls to the constructed stream's read method, objects that start at buff are not reachable through the output buffer. 
*   For OutputStream Constructor: Neither ptr nor size_out shall be a Null pointer. Unless *ptr is null, *ptr shall have been returned from a call to malloc, realloc, or calloc, where the allocation size shall be at least size_out, and MUST NOT have been freed or subsequently passed to realloc. size_out shall not be EOF unless *ptr is null (but may be 0). For reachability purposes for calls to the constructed stream's write method, objects which start at *ptr are never reachable through the input buffer (despite the value of *ptr).
