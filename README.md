PokemonSMS is a fan made project consisting of a specification and a set of Core Libraries, for which an implementation can be built off the specification. The Core Libraries and the Implementation are codependant but perfectly substitutable. Neither PokemonSMS, the PokemonSMS Public Specification Project, nor this program are affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo, Game Freak, or The Pokemon Company. 
The project and all components are not offered for a fee, and are believed to fall under Fair Dealing in the Canadian Copyright Act. It is simiarily believed to fall under Fair Use in the United States of America, and similar provisions of copyright law applicable in other jurisdictions. Pokemon, all Pokemon games, and trademarks (registered and unregistered) related to Pokemon are owned by Nintendo, Game Freak, or The Pokemon Company.

### Utility Programs

Several programs of varying size are under the `util` and are built for linking purposes. These programs achieve various tasks necessary to execute the game, but not otherwise available. 
The programs include
`io` a LCS 4 (tentative, currently available as Connor Horman LCSD 1) compatible Binary IO Library.

`shadenbt` which is used to save game progress in the ShadeNBT Format described [here](https://chorman0773.github.io/BinarySpecifiations/ShadeNBT). 

`pkmcom` which implements the PkmCom Abstract Protocol and a Number of Base Protocols, including ones not part of the PkmCom Specification. 

`collect` a basic C library that provides various data structures. 


## Building

This is a work-in-progress, however you can build the completed portions of this project. 
To build, change to a separate directory (other than the source directory, `build` is recommended), then execute the `configure` script in the source directory. After the configuration finishes, you can type make to build all completed portions. 
Initial builds will take a considerable ammount of time, due to depedencies on openssl and sqlite (which are packaged as submodules). 
In the future it may be possible to build against system versions of these libraries instead of inline built versions. 
Such versions will not be portable on GNU/Linux, however.
